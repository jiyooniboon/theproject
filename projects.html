                <h3>game development</h3>
                <p>I should be working on the game that's supposed to be my capstone project, but it just isn't happening i guess. hopefully 
                    working on other stuff will help me find the inspiration and energy i need for it

                <h3>social media</h3>
                <p>I have one knit/crochet account and one e-reader/books account, but recently I've spent too much time playing games 
                    to read or knit. Hopefully I can get back to those hobbies as well and maybe run the instagram accounts as well.
