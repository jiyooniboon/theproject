        <article>
            <h3>this website</h3>
            <p>I spent too long just thinking about what the best project would be. but any project is better than
                no project, so here i am! </p>
        </article>

        <article>
            <h3>game development</h3>
            <p>I should be working on the game that's supposed to be my capstone project, but it just isn't
                happening i guess. hopefully
                working on other stuff will help me find the inspiration and energy i need for it
            </p>

            <h3>social media</h3>
            <p>I have one knit/crochet account and one e-reader/books account, but recently I've spent too much time
                playing games
                to read or knit. Hopefully I can get back to those hobbies as well and maybe run the instagram
                accounts as well.
            </p>

        <article>
            <h3>knitting projects</h3>
            <p>a scarf, two sweaters that are about a fifth done, one sweater without sleeves, a bird that's all
                knitted but not put together,
                a granny square cardigan (i've made maybe 7 out of 40) and more
            </p>
        </article>

        <article>
            <h3>books and e-readers</h3>
            <p>trying to get back into reading, and i realized I should just read books that are fun
                instead of trying to read books that are "informative" or "probably good for me". This
                morning I finished reading God of the Woods and I really couldn't put it down. I thought that
                was something people just said in reviews.
